/* 
    Build Week 1 - Spotify Interface
    
    The goal is to create a copy of the Spotify Interface.

    The required pages are:
    - Login page
    - Home page
    - Artist page
    - Album page

    Hints:
    > Organize your styles in order to have re-usable classes amongst the different pages
    > Divide the tasks in a super clear way
    > Finish the single page before moving to the next one
    > Keep an "always on but muted" channel so that if you need help, you can just open the mic and speak out loud
    > Commit and merge often, work on separate branches.
